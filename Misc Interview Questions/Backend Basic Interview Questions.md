**Answer:**

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints for creating scalable web services. It relies on standard HTTP methods and stateless communication. RESTful APIs expose resources (e.g., users, orders) using URIs and communicate primarily via JSON or XML.

  

**Key Points:**

  

1. **Stateless:** REST APIs do not maintain a session; every request is independent.

2. **Uniform Interface:** Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

3. **Resource Representation:** Data is represented as resources identified by URIs.

  

**Difference from SOAP:**

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol with strict standards for message structure, primarily using XML. While REST is lightweight and flexible, SOAP provides more robust security (e.g., WS-Security) and transaction capabilities.

  

**Example:**

  

• REST: GET /users/123 returns user details in JSON.

• SOAP: Sends an XML payload with strict rules to retrieve user data.

  

**Why it impresses:** Highlighting practical differences and when to use each shows your understanding of real-world use cases.

  

**2. What are the HTTP methods, and when would you use each (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)?**

  

**Answer:**

HTTP methods are verbs used in RESTful APIs to perform actions on resources. Here’s when you use each:

  

1. **GET:** Retrieve data from the server without modifying it.

Example: GET /products fetches a list of products.

• Idempotent (repeated calls have the same result).

2. **POST:** Create a new resource on the server.

Example: POST /users with a JSON body creates a new user.

• Not idempotent (repeated calls create duplicates).

3. **PUT:** Update an existing resource or create it if it doesn’t exist.

Example: PUT /users/123 updates user data for ID 123.

• Idempotent.

4. **DELETE:** Remove a resource.

Example: DELETE /users/123 deletes the user with ID 123.

• Idempotent.

5. **PATCH:** Partially update a resource.

Example: PATCH /users/123 updates specific fields for user 123.

  

**Why it impresses:** Knowing these methods, their idempotency, and real-world use cases shows your deep understanding of API design principles.

  

**3. Explain the differences between monolithic and microservices architectures.**

  

**Answer:**

  

1. **Monolithic Architecture:**

• Single codebase and deployment unit.

• All components (UI, business logic, database) are tightly coupled.

• Example: A traditional e-commerce application where product listing, orders, and user authentication are in one service.

**Advantages:**

• Simple to develop, test, and deploy for small applications.

• Easier to debug due to centralized logging.

**Disadvantages:**

• Difficult to scale parts independently.

• Changes in one module can affect the entire application.

2. **Microservices Architecture:**

• Application is split into loosely coupled, independently deployable services.

• Example: Separate services for user authentication, product catalog, and order management.

**Advantages:**

• Each service can scale independently.

• Technology-agnostic (use different tech stacks for different services).

**Disadvantages:**

• Increased complexity in communication (e.g., API calls, service discovery).

• Monitoring and debugging require sophisticated tools.

  

**Why it impresses:** Providing specific pros, cons, and examples of use cases demonstrates that you can evaluate and choose the right architecture based on project needs.
