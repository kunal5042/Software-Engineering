# High Availability 
- Aims to ensure an agreed level of operation performance usually uptime, for a higher than normal period. 
- Maximise the uptime

1. 99.9% (three 9's) = 8.77 hours p/year downtime
2. 99.999% (five 9's) = 5.26 minutes p/year downtime

# Fault Tolerance

- Operational in failures, much more complex and expensive than HA
