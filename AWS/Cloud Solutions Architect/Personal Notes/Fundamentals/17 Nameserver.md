### TLD Nameservers
- **Function:** TLD nameservers store DNS information for specific top-level domains (e.g., .com, .org, .net).
    
- **Authority:** They are authoritative for their respective TLDs, holding official DNS records for them.
    
- **Hierarchy:** TLD nameservers are at the highest level in the DNS hierarchy, just below root nameservers.
    
- **Responsibilities:** They handle queries for domain names within their TLDs, routing queries to the authoritative nameservers for lower-level domains.
    
- **Identifiers:** TLD nameservers are identified by domain names corresponding to the TLD they serve (e.g., a.gtld-servers.net for .com).
    
- **Operated by Registry:** Usually operated by the registry managing the TLD, ensuring accurate DNS data for domains under that TLD.
### Nameserver Root Server

It's the starting point for DNS resolution. 
- **Function:** They store the top-level domain (TLD) information like .com, .org, .net, etc.
- **Responsibility:** They direct queries to the appropriate TLD nameservers, helping in resolving domain names to IP addresses.
- **Identified by:** In DNS notation, they are represented by a dot (.).

### CNAME Records

A CNAME (Canonical Name) record is used in DNS to create an alias from one domain name to another. 
- **Purpose:** They allow a domain to point to another domain, essentially acting as a pointer or alias.
- **Usage:** Commonly used for subdomains (e.g., [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/) pointing to example.com).
- **Syntax:** The record consists of the alias (subdomain) and the canonical name (target domain).

Example:

`CNAME Record: - Alias: www - Canonical Name: example.com`

### MX Records

MX (Mail Exchange) records are DNS records that specify the mail servers responsible for receiving email on behalf of a domain. Key points about MX records include:

- **Usage:** They are crucial for email delivery, as they define the email server's hostname and priority.
- **Priority:** Multiple MX records can be set with different priorities, where lower values indicate higher priority.
- **Syntax:** An MX record includes the mail server hostname and its priority value.

Example:

`MX Record: - Priority: 10 - Mail Server: mail.example.com`


### TXT Records

TXT (Text) records are DNS records used to store arbitrary text-based information associated with a domain. Key points about TXT records include:

- **Purpose:** They can serve various purposes, such as domain ownership verification, email authentication (SPF, DKIM), and providing general text information.
    
- **Format:** TXT records consist of a domain name, a TTL (Time To Live) value, a record type (TXT), and the text data enclosed in double quotes or as plain text.
    
- **Usage Examples:**
    
    - SPF (Sender Policy Framework): Specifies authorized email servers for a domain.
    - DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail): Adds a digital signature to email messages for authentication.
    - Domain Verification: Used by services like Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 for domain ownership verification.
    - General Text Information: Can include human-readable text or machine-readable data as needed.
- **Multiple Records:** Multiple TXT records can exist for a single domain, allowing for different purposes or services to be specified.
    
- **Verification and Security:** TXT records play a crucial role in email authentication, domain verification, and overall DNS security
